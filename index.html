CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE

You will create your own CYOA. If you are unsure of what a CYOA is, check out this link: https://chooseyourstory.com/

There are only a few requirements:
* must use radio buttons, checkboxes and text input, at least one of each
* must have at least 10 choices the user must make
* must have functions
* must have If-statements
* must have complete CSS and HTML
* must be uploaded to Github and included on your profile page

You may design the program however you see. I want to see how you put the pieces together. We have done ALOT of exercises and notes on various techniques for designing programs and using functions. Time for you to put it all together on your own. 

This work is a culmination of everything we have done in the class this semester. Please give me your best ORIGINAL work.

     <p>"As you put on the VR helmet to begin the A.R.A.E. Test you think to yourself, I need to do well to get out into the field as soon as possible. As the bootup screen appears letters spelling out A.R.A.E. as well as a eagle holding arrows in one claw and a scroll in the other. As that screen passes a slight shimmer seems to cause a new screen to be presented stating: Do you wish begin the test?"</p>
